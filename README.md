# Urine Strip Test Assignment
This assignment involves creating a web interface that allows users to upload an image of their
urine strip (see below) and identify the colors on the strip (see strip images below). Each strip
will have 10 colors. You will have to analyze the image (hint: use open CV) and return the
results as a json with 10 colors (RGB values).
